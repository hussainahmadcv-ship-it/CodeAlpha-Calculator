🧮 Calculator App
Hey there! 👋 I built this calculator as a fun little project to brush up on my web dev fundamentals. It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done and looks pretty clean doing it.
✨ What It Does
So basically, you've got all your standard calculator stuff here:
Clean interface – I tried to keep it simple and easy on the eyes
Works everywhere – Whether you're on your phone during lunch or at your desk, it adapts nicely
The usual suspects – Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division... you know the drill
Hit C to start over – Made a mistake? No worries, just clear it and try again
See your numbers as you type – The display updates in real-time so you always know what you're working with
🔧 What's Under the Hood
I kept the tech stack pretty straightforward:
HTML5 for the bones of the app
CSS3 to make it look nice (spent way too much time tweaking colors, not gonna lie)
Vanilla JavaScript for all the calculator magic – no frameworks needed!

💭 Why I Made This
Honestly? Sometimes you just need to go back to basics. This project reminded me how much you can accomplish with just the core web technologies. Plus, it's always satisfying to build something that actually works and looks decent.
Feel free to poke around the code – and if you spot something that could be better, I'm all ears!
